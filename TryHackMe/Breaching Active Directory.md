# Intro
AD is used on 90% of Fortune 500 companies. Existence of Windows almost guarantees AD.
### Breaching
we need a set of valid creds, but the attack surface is massive
Avenues:
- NTLM Authenticated Services
- LDAP Bind Credentials
- Authentication Relays
- Microsoft Deployment Toolkit
- Configuration Files

### [[Connect to VPN]]


# OSINT
- Users ask questions on forums and give away creds accidentally
- Developers hardcode creds in a script
- Creds leaked in a big breach on one site / company can be reused elsewhere
### Phishing
Input user creds into fake site, or get them to run a RAT (Remote Access Trojan)
