Nessus Vulnerability Scanner - typically a loud, but comprehensive scanner with lots of automation

Metasploit has some automation for scanning as well

Commonly tested vulnerabilities:
Security Misconfigurations - exposed information or privilege escalation
Broken Access Control - unintended access to data or controls
Insecure Deserialization - insecure processing of data across an app
Injection - input fields without sanitization, allowing for code exec

Finding Manual Exploits:
- Rapid7 (much like Exploit DB and NVE) but geared more towards exploits with Metasploit
- GitHub contains many proof of concept exploits, but they may not work, or have 0 support
- Searchsploit is stock on Kali, offline copy of Exploit-DB through terminal

exploits ie `exploit.py` will often come with a --help for options

Example Manual Exploitation
- Port scan target machine
- Visit website and find application version: Online Book Store v1.0
- Look up version on Searchsploit, go to remote code exec exploit located at  listed filepath
- copy to home dir for easier access
- use `python exploit.py -h` to figure out usage
- execute script with intended URL: `python exploit.py http://HOST_IP.com`, it provides an interactive shell
- Gain shell, `ls` to scope out directory, then `cat flag.txt`
