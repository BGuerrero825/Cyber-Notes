Types

Operating System - These types of vulnerabilities are found within Operating Systems (OSs) and often result in privilege escalation.
(Mis)Configuration-based -These types of vulnerability stem from an incorrectly configured application or service. For example, a website exposing customer details.
Weak or Default Credentials - Applications and services that have an element of authentication will come with default credentials when installed. For example, an administrator dashboard may have the username and password of "admin". These are easy to guess by an attacker. 
Application Logic - These vulnerabilities are a result of poorly designed applications. For example, poorly implemented authentication mechanisms that may result in an attacker being able to impersonate a user.
Human-Factor - Human-Factor vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that leverage human behaviour. For example, phishing emails are designed to trick humans into believing they are legitimate.



Scoring Systems

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores vulerabilities on features, availability, and reproducability. General impact on the CIA triangle. Open-source
None--Low--Medium--High--Critical

Vulnerability Priority Rating (VPR) scores vulnerabilities based on risk to an organization, ie. relevance in industry and resulting impact. Scores are more dynamic as a result. Closed-source



Vulnerability Databases

National Vulnerability Database (NVD) generates Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)
CVE-YEAR-ID_NUMBER
not great when searching for vulnerabilities for a specific application or scenario

Exploit-DB stores exploits for software under name, author, and version of the software. Also often contain PoC (Proof of concept) that we can use
