Example Box:
- Deploy machine
- nmap scan with `nmap -F HOST_IP`, I also ran a `-p-` on the side to test all ports but got nothing valuable
- Saw an http service on port 80, used `nmap -A -p80 HOST_IP` to interrogate service, its running FUEL CMS (from banner grab)
- Navigated to webpage and found FUEL CMS v1.4
- Looked up CVE for remote code execution on nvd.nist.gov
- Then used searchsploit "Fuel CMS" to find a matching exploit
- Moved an exploit into home dir for easier access/editing
- Immediately got errors, assumed wrong version of python used, so `find /usr/bin/ -iname "python*"` to find installed versions of python
- Tried multiple versions, nothing worked cleanly, so settled on python3 and edited code with `nano` which I kept running for error output
- Eventually got it to work, but forgot to change the target IP in the script
- Then also realized there was a preconfigured route to default BURP proxy in script
- Executed again with all fixes, finally got interactive shell and ran `ls` which gave nothing useful (webpage html clogged terminal after response too)
- Used prompt from THM to navigate to ubuntu dir and cat flag with with `cat /home/ubuntu/flag.txt`
