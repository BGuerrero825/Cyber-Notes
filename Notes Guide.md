# Reference Notes
Don't repeat man pages or easy google look-ups.
Make or add to Reference notes when the info is:
- Hard to find
- Not well understood (so I can iterate on it later)
- Helpful to avoiding pitfalls / anti-patterns

### Reference
- Example usages
	- Explanations
- Notes / thoughts on this topic
- Links
