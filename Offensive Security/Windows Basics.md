### Windows I
- `Administrator` & `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` : are privileged user and non-user accounts
- Drives and devices, instead of everything being a file
- Registry is similar to `/etc` and `/proc`
- Windows works on a comprehensive compatibility philosophy vs Linux's optimization philosophy (distros)
