### Basic Example
in C, the main function is called by the OS when the process starts
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
	char buffer[64];

	if (argc < 2)
	{
		printf("Error - You must supply at least one argument\n");
		
		return 1;
	}
	
	strcpy(buffer, argv[1]);
	
  return 0;
}
```
64 bytes are reserved on the stack frame for the main function
`argc` : number of arguments passed to main (int)
`argv` : array of pointers to the args
The buffer overflows into return address space on the stack, when its popped into the EIP and attempts to jump it will trigger an access violation, crashing the app because the address is not in process memory space

Reliable EIP control means execution of arbitrary code.
Use `services.msc` to restart a program from a crash while deving an exploit
