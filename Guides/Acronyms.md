#### LLVM (Low Level Virtual Machine)
A language-independent intermediate representation (portable, high level assembly-like language), but also a debugger, C++ standard library implementation, and the Clang compiler.

#### LVM (Logical Volume Management)
a storage virtualization system offering a more flexible approach than traditional partitioning. Physical volumes are mapped into physical extents, allowing some regions to overlap at their peak volumes and allowing others to remain unallocated until needed. 

#### GPT (GUID Partition Table)
Standard disk partitioning layout where Globally Unique IDs are used to partition tables of the physical storage device
